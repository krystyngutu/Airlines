# Flight Tracker & Prediction Model

**Step 1: Load Live Airline Data to Track all Global Flights**

**Step 2: Flight Delay Prediction Model**
   - Use historical flight data, weather data, and airport congestion data to build a machine learning model that predicts flight delays.
   - Features: Departure airport, arrival airport, scheduled departure time, airline, past delays, and weather conditions.
   - Tools: `scikit-learn`, `XGBoost`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`

**Step 3: Air Traffic Pattern Analysis**
   - Analyze traffic congestion at major airports and visualize seasonal, weekly, and hourly trends.
   - Use geospatial tools (`geopandas`, `plotly`, `folium`) to map flight density.
   - Can be used for optimizing airport operations or policy recommendations.

**Step 4: Flight Price Optimization and Trend Analysis**
   - Scrape flight prices from airline websites or APIs like Skyscanner, Google Flights.
   - Predict best times to buy tickets based on past price fluctuations and demand trends.
   - Build a dashboard for real-time price tracking.

**Step 5: Fuel Efficiency & Carbon Emissions Analytics**
   - Use flight data and aircraft models to estimate fuel consumption and CO2 emissions.
   - Identify the most and least efficient flight routes.
   - Can be pitched as a sustainability-focused project.

**step 6: Anomaly Detection for Flight Safety**
   - Detect abnormal flight behavior using machine learning on real-time telemetry data (speed, altitude, route).
   - Alert if a flight deviates significantly from expected patterns.
   - Can be integrated with aviation safety protocols.

**Step 7: Passenger Sentiment Analysis on Flights**
   - Scrape airline reviews from sources like Twitter, TripAdvisor, Reddit.
   - Use NLP (`spaCy`, `transformers`) to classify passenger sentiment and common complaints.
   - Build a dashboard for airlines to track customer satisfaction.

**Step 8: Airline Route Optimization**
   - Use flight route data, weather conditions, and delays to find the most efficient routes.
   - Can be expanded to a real-time suggestion system for pilots.
   - Uses `networkx` for route optimization and `geopandas` for visualization.
