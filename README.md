# Flight Tracker & Prediction Model

**Load Live Airline Data to Track all Global Flights**
- Scrape flight prices using Google Flights API.

**Analyze Flight Prices, Trends & Carbon Emissions Analytics**
- Predict best times to buy tickets based on past price fluctuations and demand trends.
- Build dashboard for real-time price tracking.
- Assess flight data and aircraft models to estimate fuel consumption and CO2 emissions.
- Identify the most and least efficient flight routes.
 - Pitch sustainability-focused approach.

**Potential Next Steps: Anomaly Detection for Flight Safety and Airline Route Optimization**
- Detect abnormal flight behavior using machine learning on real-time telemetry data (speed, altitude, route).
- Use flight route data, weather conditions, and delays to find the most efficient routes.
- Can be expanded to a real-time suggestion system for pilots.
- Uses `networkx` for route optimization and `geopandas` for visualization.
